in function knowledge update:
	A(x,y) is the subset of cells (x',y') of the grid that are antecedent of the cell (x,y) by the current eye movement
	?: How big the subset could be?
	?: i.e. how many cells do I see?
	S: my simplification, I take only one cell at the time as antecedent but I work with a subset

in function occupancy_vs:
	?: the probabilities are quite small
	S: the module bigfloat
