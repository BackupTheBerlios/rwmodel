in function knowledge update:
	A(x,y) is the subset of cells (x',y') of the grid that are antecedent of the cell (x,y) by the current eye movement
	?: How big the subset could be?
	?: i.e. how many cells do I see?
	S: my simplification, I take only one cell at the time as antecedent but I work with a subset

in function occupancy_vs:
	?: the probabilities are quite small
	S: the module bigfloat

in function pmt:
	The distribution over the eye movement can be chosen arbitrarily as the results of inference do not depend on it
	?: the space of all possible eye movements is given (x-x', y-y'), where (x,y) is an actual position and (x',y') is the antecendent position
	?: I will map the chosen distribution onto the space and return value according to the actual eye movement
	?: Which distribution suits the best?
	?: What is the ideal mapping?

in function dynamic_object_model:
	P((p,theta)|(x,y)) is a uniform distribution on the inverse image of (p,theta) by eye movement M^t
	?: Is it enough just to generate numpy.random.uniform() or does the "on the inverse image of (p,theta) play any important role in the generation?
	?: numpy.random.uniform(min, max, size), where size should be the number of cells?
	S: the simplification by generating just a uniform distribution

in function dynamic_object_model:
	?: how many antecedent positions?
	S: I take just one

in function knowledge_update()
	?: when does it stop
	?:the sum over O^t-1_A(x,y)
	?:how to make it recursive
	?:A(x,y) is the subset of cells that the eye_gaze is pointed at during the movement

in both function knowledge_update and joint_distribution
	? how to make calculation work - underflow
